# 🩺 Diabetes Outcome Prediction: Linear vs Ridge Regression

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetes occurrence using regression techniques. By comparing Linear Regression and Ridge Regression models, the goal is to identify the most effective method for accurate predictions, thereby assisting in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

## 📚 Dataset

- **Source**: [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
- **Description**: The dataset includes medical and demographic data for female patients of Pima Indian heritage, aged 21 and above. Features encompass:
  - Number of pregnancies
  - Glucose concentration
  - Blood pressure
  - Skin thickness
  - Insulin levels
  - Body Mass Index (BMI)
  - Diabetes pedigree function
  - Age
  - Outcome (1: diabetes positive, 0: diabetes negative)

## 🛠️ Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Addressed missing values by imputing or removing incomplete records.
   - Applied feature scaling using StandardScaler to normalize data.

2. **Model Implementation**:
   - Developed Linear Regression and Ridge Regression models using scikit-learn.
   - Conducted hyperparameter tuning for Ridge Regression to determine the optimal regularization strength.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
   - R-squared (R²) score
   - Residual analysis through visualization
