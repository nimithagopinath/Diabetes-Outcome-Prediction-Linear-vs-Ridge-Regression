# Diabetes-Outcome-Prediction-Linear-vs-Ridge-Regression
Developed predictive models to accurately forecast the likelihood of diabetes occurrence and assess the associated risk level by leveraging advanced regression techniques.

Utilized prominent Python libraries, including pandas and scikit-learn, for robust data preprocessing tasks, encompassing handling missing values, scaling features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets

Compared the performance of linear regression and ridge regression models based on their respective RMSE values, highlighting the effectiveness of ridge regression in reducing prediction errors.
